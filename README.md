The weather dashboard is a simple display of the current weather and a 5-day forecast.

The site displays the weather for New York by default but the user is able to search for weather by city.

The user's search results are saved to local storage and they can clear their search history anytime.

Today's weather panel shows temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index, which is color coded for safety.

The 5 day forcast includes temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

Weather data is provided by https://openweathermap.org/.
